### Description

This is a simple cross-platform app for calculating who ows whom how much when people put money together for doing something. You can start a project, add participants and then enter spendings. Hit a button at any time to create an overview, showing the current status in dept and credit. Every item and project can be edited.

I started this project to learn more about app development for the Android platform, using various online resources. I chose Xamarin as a framework to make use of already existing .NET skills. Initially I planed to make this app available as a native Windows (UWP) application aswell, however after discovering how poorly this feature is currently supported by Xarmarin, I abandoned this plan.

Some things are difficult to figure out by oneself, valuable help came from:

Apart from that the Microsoft tutorials can be recommended in general to get started.
